# Open Food Facts Community Portal
<b> A community portal for our organization contributors </b> ðŸ˜„

IMPORTANT NOTE: This project (originally a GSoC project) is dormant, since it was too large and too ambitious (it amounts to implementing a full social network). Please don't invest time fixing it before we rescope it.
